I forgot to add in the sql import initially, i was in a rush to leave for work hence me forgetting, very silly from me, i have added it into the repository and you can see that all other files have the same untouched upload times.
I am sorry for the inconvienience and I hope that you guys can understand my situation and not be too harsh on me :)

In terms of an actual readme, everything is straight forward so long as you drop all files into appropriate folder, eg, htdocs on MAMP/XAMP

Thanks
