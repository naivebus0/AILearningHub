    <h1>ChatGPT</h1>
    <p>ChatGPT is changing the way we interact with machines. Created by OpenAI, this AI can do almost anything from generating business ideas to writing solutions and answering any questions you might have.</p>
    <p>It's not just about answering questions; it's about providing a conversation that feels humanlike. ChatGPT is currently one of the most popular AI tools available, with good reason. However, with the good, also comes the bad. This tool is highly controversial in terms of the service it provides.</p>
    <p>I'm sure we all know the brillance ChatGPT brings, so lets shed some light on the problems that can be faced to raise awareness:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="cons"><strong>Accuracy Issues:</strong> It can often generate incorrect information if not properly supervised, leading to potentially misleading or harmful advice.</li><br>
      <li class="cons"><strong>Employment Issues:</strong> There's a significant concern about job displacement in sectors that rely on basic customer service roles, as AI tools like ChatGPT can automate these jobs, potentially leading to unemployment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You know what? Let's give OpenAI the recognition they deserve by creating a tool such as ChatGPT. Let's just go over some features it offers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="pros"><strong>Flexibility:</strong> ChatGPT is always available, your certain query or questions can be answered at any time, no matter the time, location, or device as OpenAI also developed a ChatGPT app for iOS and Android too.</li><br>
      <li class="pros"><strong>Educational Support:</strong> A very hot topic, but in our eyes, using this tool for educational purposes is a great idea. It is common that students tend to struggle with their work, but are too embarassed to let their relevant educators know.<br><br>By using ChatGPT correctly, it can serve as a personal tutor for students, explaining complex subjects in an calm and reassuring manner, enhancing understanding. Rather than using ChatGPT to outright complete your work, it is advised to use it as a learning tool to help broaden your knowledge and make the learning experience a lot more enjoyable.</li>

    <h1>Gemini</h1><br>
    <p>Very similarly to ChatGPT, Gemini is an another tool that can provide such assistance that GPT does, however it is alot more advanced in some situations. For example, it is stated from Google (here) themselves that "It can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image and video."</p><br>
    <p>Which in other words, simply means that if you were to upload a media to the model, asking to summarise what is going on, it would be able to describe what is going on in that code, audio, image, or video, handy right? </p><br>
    <p>Let's go over some of Geminis benefits and setbacks.</p><br>
    <ul>
      <li class="pros"><strong>Content Upload:</strong> Able to describe context in images, audio, video, and code.</li><br>
      <li class="pros"><strong>Variety in Descriptions:</strong> Gemini can provide support in many different programming languages, such as HTML, JSON, PHP... and more. </li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>Here are some limitations to Gemini too, it is important to look into both when understanding these tools.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="cons"><strong>Spatial/Depth Complications:</strong> Gemini finds it difficult to deal with objects, more specifically, precisely placed object/text placement in content.</li><br>
      <li class="cons"><strong>Complex Instructions:</strong> Often struggles with demands from the user that contains a large sequence of instructions. It is recommended to break down steps in order to recieve better guidance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Certainly an alternative to ChatGPT, whilst these two both offer similar services, they both have things that set them back, whilst other things that excel them further than their competitors.</p>
    <p1>Feel free to explore Gemini by clicking the logo!</p1>

    <h1>QuillBot</h1>
    <p>Now, Quillbot, whilst it is an AITool, works in a spectacular way of its own. Rather than asking it to generate content for you, it can do a number of things such as:</p>
    <li>Paraphraser</li>
      <li>Grammar Checker</li>
        <li>Flow Checker</li>
          <li>Summariser</li>
          <p>Yes, all of this is done with AI! - It's normal for us to make mistakes in our work, having these tools can help reduce the amount of times we make these mistakes, and can generally improve the quality of writing.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="cons"><strong>Misunderstanding: </strong> Since it is AI, it is common that it will make mistakes, it may not make any at all, but regarding your text, it may misunderstand the context of your text and can suggest wrong changes. </li><br>
      <li class="cons"><strong>Originality:</strong> Having a tool that essentially changes up what you have written, but in the context of just improving your work can be seen differently by everyone... what are your thoughts?</li><br>
    </ul>
    <p>Yes, it can have some complications, what doesn't nowadays? Let's appreciate what QuillBot can do for us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="pros"><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> As you can tell, it is so easy to use these tools, just copy and paste and you are done. With the option to apply all, or just go through and change what you feel is needed, it is easy for everyone.</li><br>
      <li class="pros"><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> No matter the situation, the level writer you are, your content, QuillBot can help. Improve grammar, rephrase sentences that you may think you are repeating, recommend changes to improve the standard of your writing.</li><br>
      <li class="pros"><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Since the tool is free and widely available online, it is extremely useful for users who may struggle with being comfortable with the native language of their country. QuillBot can help them create pieces of writing that are significantly improved in terms of quality, clarity and flow of the text.</li><br>
    </ul>

    <h1>Grok</h1>
    <p>A tool created by none other than Elon Musk! But what does it do?</p>
    <p>Grok is similiar to ChatGPT and Gemini in the way that it is an AI Tool able to support users and provide answers to anything. However, what seperates Grok from ChatGPT and Gemini? </p>
    <p>Well, Grok is able to access real-time knowledge using its partner platform, formerly known as Twitter, now X..., which is a conversation for another day in itself.<p>
    <p>What does this mean? This means Grok is able to access any information that is available on X, meaning that it has knowledge of current trends and even goverment advice.</p>
    <p>Grok is also known to provide humurous and 'troll' responses as part of it's personality, which can be funny to some as it helps bring the tool to life, but as stated by Musk himself, "Don't use if you hate humor", How do you feel about something like this?<p>
    <p>Let's jump into some problems that arises with Grok.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="cons"><strong>Unethical Approach: </strong> As mentioned before, it's personality may not be the biggest hit for alot of its users. User's will be looking for assistance and not for jokes and remarks made by the AI, since it is not a human it is also possible for the tool to make a remark that may not come across right with the user.</li><br>
      <li class="cons"><strong>Competitors:</strong> Covered already, Grok has many competitors that can be seen as being ahead already in terms of effectiveness and ease of use, users may choose to go with something more familiar and more accessible such as ChatGPT.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Understanding these concerns helps us approach this technology with a balanced perspective, appreciating its benefits while being aware of its limitations. However, let's give OpenAI the recognition they deserve by creating a tool such as ChatGPT. Let's just go over some features it offers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="pros"><strong>Connections:</strong> Grok is able to access any information that is available on X, meaning that it has the additionaly knowledge over its competitors.</li><br>
      <li class="pros"><strong>Scalability:</strong> Since Elon Must is known for his activities in space, electrical vehicles and more - having these as likely partners for Grok, the integration into these technologies is something to look forward to.</li>
